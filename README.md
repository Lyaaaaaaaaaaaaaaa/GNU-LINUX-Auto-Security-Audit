# GNU-LINUX-Auto-Security-Audit
---

## What does this project do?

It checks your Linux system and reports in a well formatted file what you should probably do to have a safer system.
**It doesn't need root privileges**

It is inspired by the [configuration recommendations of a GNU/Linux system](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/guide/configuration-recommendations-of-a-gnulinux-system/) guide by the [ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en) (the french National Agency of Information System Security) 

## How to use it?

1. Give the executable right to the script `chmod +x script.sh`.
2. Run it **(you don't need root privileges)** `./script.sh`.
3. Grab your favourite drink and wait until the script ends.

## Why is this project useful?

I had to improve the security of a CentOS server and read the ANSSI's guide. I listed the points I could easily do
and thought it would be better to have a script doing most of it for me. So I'm sharing it.
